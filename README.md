## Overview - Creating Packages

Packages allow us organize and group modules (or python files). Python requires a specific structure for package definitions.
The directory name is the name of the package used in an import statement (`import package_name`). The submodules can be access as attributes of the package as in `package_name.submodule_name`.

```bash
├── numseq
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── fib.py
│   ├── geo.py
│   ├── prime.py
```

### \_\_init\_\_.py

> The \_\_init\_\_.py files are required to make Python treat directories
> containing the file as packages. This prevents directories with a common
> name, such as string, unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later
> on the module search path. In the simplest case, \_\_init\_\_.py can just be an
> empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or
> set the \_\_all\_\_ variable, described later.
